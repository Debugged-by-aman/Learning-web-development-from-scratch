# Learning-web-development-from-scratch
I'm learning web development from the ground upâ€”starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This GitHub is my space to share progress, practice projects, and everything I create along the way. I'm excited to sharpen my skills step by step and work toward becoming a full-stack developer. More updates coming soon!
