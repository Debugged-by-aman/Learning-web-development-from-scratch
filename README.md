📘 Learning Web Development from Scratch
Welcome to my journey of becoming a full-stack web developer! This GitHub repository serves as a diary of my progress, practice projects, and milestones. I'm starting with the fundamentals—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—and gradually building up my skills.


🔰 Lesson 1: Designing Buttons with HTML & Basic CSS
In this first step, I explored how to create buttons using simple HTML elements and style them using basic CSS properties like color, background-color, border, and font-size.

🖱️ Lesson 2: Hover Effects on Buttons
Next, I learned how to enhance the user interface by adding hover effects using the :hover pseudo-class in CSS. This interaction gives users visual feedback when they place their cursor over a button.


✍️ Lesson 3: Text Styling Techniques
I explored different methods for styling text with CSS. This includes adjusting font size, weight, color, shadow, spacing, and more to create visually appealing typography.

Examples of Styled Text:

📏 Lesson 4: Understanding Padding and Sizing Elements
In this lesson, I focused on sizing buttons and other elements using padding. I learned how internal spacing affects the size and appearance of elements, which is crucial for clean and user-friendly interfaces.


🛒 Lesson 5: Structured HTML Layout (Amazon Design)
I practiced writing well-structured HTML code to replicate a simplified version of the Amazon layout. This included using semantic tags like <head>, <body> and <title>, and aligning sections for a clear and modular structure.
